# Traffic-Data-Analysis
This project is a Python-based traffic data analysis tool that processes CSV datasets containing vehicle movement data at two junctions. 
It provides insights into traffic flow, vehicle count, speed analysis, peak hours, and more.

The project includes:
-  User input validation for date selection.
-  Data processing and filtering based on CSV datasets.
-  Statistical insights on traffic patterns.
-  Graphical visualization using Tkinter-based histograms.
-  Text file output for results storage.

ðŸ›  Features:
    âœ… Input Validation: Ensures users enter valid dates in DD MM YYYY format.
    âœ… Data Analysis: Calculates total vehicle count, truck percentage, electric vehicles, peak hours, and more.
    âœ… Graphical Representation: Uses Tkinter to generate histograms for vehicle frequency by hour.
    âœ… File Handling: Saves processed results into a results.txt file and appends new entries when re-run.
    âœ… Multiple CSV Handling: Allows analysis for different days using a loop.
